# Netflix-Subscriptions-Forecasting-project

This project focuses on forecasting Netflix's subscription growth using time series analysis in Python. Accurate forecasting enables Netflix to make informed decisions regarding content creation, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

The teckstacks that I used to make this project are: Python 3.13.1, Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, starmodels.

Forecasting the number of subscriptions Netflix will achieve in a given time period is a vital business practice that enables them to plan, strategize, and make data-driven decisions. It enhances operational efficiency, financial planning, and content strategy, ultimately contributing to their success and growth in the highly competitive streaming industry. This project demonstrates how to perform such forecasting using Python.

The dataset contains Netflix's subscription counts at the start of each quarter from 2013 to 2023. You can find dataset from the link mentioned below.

The tasks I have prformed while making this project are Gather historical Netflix subscription data, Clean and format the data for analysis, Visualize and understand trends and patterns, Choose an appropriate time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA), Train the model using historical data, Predict future subscription counts, Assess the model's performance and accuracy.

The whole description of the project including data analysis, graph analysis etc. I have mentioned in a google document. The link of the google document I have mentioned below.
